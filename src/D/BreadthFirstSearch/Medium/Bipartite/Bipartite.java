 *
 * Description
 * Determine if an undirected graph is bipartite. A bipartite graph is one in which the nodes can be divided into two groups such that no nodes have direct edges to other nodes in the same group.
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * 1  --   2
 *
 *     /
 *
 * 3  --   4
 *
 * is bipartite (1, 3 in group 1 and 2, 4 in group 2).
 *
 * 1  --   2
 *
 *     /   |
 *
 * 3  --   4
 *
 * is not bipartite.
 *
 * Assumptions
 *
 * The graph is represented by a list of nodes, and the list of nodes is not null.
